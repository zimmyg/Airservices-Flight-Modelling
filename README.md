<h1>Airservices Flight Modelling</h1>

This is a project that was created in partnership with La Trobe University and Airservices Australia in accordance with their specifications.

It uses NASA's Worldwind as well as OpenCSV to achieve its goal of loading and displaying flight paths over a world map, which facilitates the inspection of flight paths in a real-world and real-time context.

<h4>Building and Running:</h4>
In order to build and run this project, you'll need to have the Worldwind 2.0 project already set up in your workspace (whichever environment that may be).

Instructions on how to do this can be found on the Worldwind site http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/

Once this is done, you just need to link your project to depend on your Worldwind project, and also add OpenCSV to your build path.

If all that goes well, you're set to go!
